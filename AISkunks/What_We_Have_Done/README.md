Northeastern University Fostering Engineering Innovation in Education Award 2022    
Awardee: Nik Bear Brown for AI Skunkworks     

I won the singular Northeastern University Fostering Engineering Innovation in Education Award for 2021-22. The Award recognizes outstanding College of Engineering educators for their extraordinary efforts during the past year to enhance our students’ knowledge, skills and ability to innovate as 21st century engineers. Specifically, nominees will have demonstrated fostering of technological innovation or innovative engineering design, with sustainable value for society, in undergraduate engineering courses that bridge between first year cornerstone and capstone experiences, or in graduate courses.

Red Hat Academy Director's Award for 2020    
Awardee: Nik Bear Brown for AI Skunkworks      

This singualr award was given for mentoring over 300 students through the Red Hat training materials for becoming Linux system administrators or DevOps programmers. Only one Red Hat Academy Director's Award is given each year out of the thousands of schools that take advantage of the Red Hat Academy material to train students to become Linux system administrators and DevOps programmers.

 ## Projects    
 
 Cognitive Type Project
 
 Mapping Typography to Cognition - The Cognitive Type Project is about creating computational tools which will allow the design of beautiful typefaces which have different cognitive properties. This will allow typographers to design type for such things as better click-through rates on Google ads, children's books that improve reading levels, or companies that better understand how their customers react to the text in their media. http://cognitivetype.org

 ## Data  
 
The PANOSE dataset annotates thousands of typefaces with 10 concatenated numeric values in which a typographer classifies a type by Serif Style, Weight, Proportion, Contrast, Stroke Variation, Arm Style, Letterform, Midline, and X-height.
