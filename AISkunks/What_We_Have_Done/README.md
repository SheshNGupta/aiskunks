# AI Skunkworks - What We Have Done?

AI Skunks is an experiential AI playground whose mission is to use technology and AI to teach research, creativity, and entrepreneurial thinking and skills.

Experiential AI is learning AI by doing AI. Experiential learning is the process of learning by doing. By engaging in hands-on experiences and reflection, people learn how to apply knowledge to real-world situations.

Mentorship is critical for experiential learning. The primary purpose of Skunks.ai is to connect more experienced AI nerds with those less experienced and have them work on open-source code, tutorials, or writing articles.

 ## Projects    
 
 *Cognitive Type Project*  
 
 Mapping Typography to Cognition - The Cognitive Type Project is about creating computational tools which will allow the design of beautiful typefaces which have different cognitive properties. This will allow typographers to design type for such things as better click-through rates on Google ads, children's books that improve reading levels, or companies that better understand how their customers react to the text in their media. http://cognitivetype.org

 ## Data  
 
 *PANOSE Typography*
The PANOSE dataset annotates thousands of typefaces with 10 concatenated numeric values in which a typographer classifies a type by Serif Style, Weight, Proportion, Contrast, Stroke Variation, Arm Style, Letterform, Midline, and X-height.

*Klee - An open-source procedural AI engine*

Visual procedural programming allows for very rapid, highly performant and iterative programming making it a great acrhitecture for machine learning and MLOPs. Node-based programming can be mixed with scripting.

This style of programming has been proven in VFX and game engines like SideFX Houdini, Unity 3D, and Unreal Engine. Games like Fortnite are almost entirely built using visual programming.

This software architecture allows data scientists, biologists, reseachers, Kagglers and anyone interested in developing custom AI applications to be far more effective than they would be writing lots of scripts and notebooks.
